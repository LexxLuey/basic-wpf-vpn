# Windows (.NET 9, WPF) MVP VPN Client — Implementation Plan

Here’s a clear, step-by-step implementation plan and a list of core components/subsystems for your Windows (.NET 9, WPF) MVP VPN client:

---

## Step-by-Step Implementation Plan

1. **Project Setup**
   - Create a new WPF (.NET 9) solution.
   - Structure folders for Core, Infrastructure, and Presentation.

2. **Define Models**
   - Create models for `User`, `VpnNode`, and `Session`.

3. **Authentication Flow**
   - Build a simple, user-friendly Sign In screen in XAML (WPF).
   - Implement an `IAuthService` interface and a concrete `MockAuthService` that reads user credentials from a local JSON file or in-memory list.
   - Validate credentials in the service, and if successful, create a `Session` object to store the authenticated user.
   - Use MVVM pattern for clean separation of UI and logic.

4. **VPN Node Discovery**
   - Create a mock REST API endpoint (local or in-memory) or use a local JSON file for node data.
   - Implement an `IVpnService` interface and a `MockVpnService` to fetch nodes.
   - Ensure fallback to local data if API is unavailable.

5. **UI for Node List & Connection**
   - Design a node list view in XAML using ItemsControl or ListView.
   - Display node details (name, country, latency) and a **Connect** button for each node.
   - Use ViewModels for data-binding and state management.

6. **Simulated VPN Connection**
   - On connect, simulate tunnel creation by changing connection state in the ViewModel.
   - Implement the State pattern for connection status (Disconnected, Connecting, Connected).
   - Toggle UI state (button text, status bar) and show native Windows notifications.
   - Store session info (current user and connected node) in memory.

7. **Apply SOLID Principles & Design Patterns**
   - Use interfaces for services (`IAuthService`, `IVpnService`).
   - Apply State pattern for connection status.
   - Use Factory for service instantiation if needed.
   - Keep code modular and testable.

8. **Error Handling & Fallbacks**
   - Simulate failed login and node fetch scenarios.
   - Provide user-friendly error messages and graceful fallbacks.

9. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for authentication and node services.
   - Test UI flows and error handling.

10. **Documentation & Submission**
    - Prepare `README.md` with setup, architecture, AI prompts, bug fixes, and mock API details.
    - Capture screenshots of AI-generated code and debugging.
    - Record a short demo video.
